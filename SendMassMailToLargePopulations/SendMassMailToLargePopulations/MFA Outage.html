This includes our campus and others utilizing 2-Step for Microsoft Office 365. This outage, first reported by Microsoft&rsquo;s clients in Asia, has lasted more than 10 hours and is impacting millions of users across the world. Microsoft has not provided an estimated timeframe to resolve this problem.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If you were already logged into your email this morning, you most likely have not noticed this outage. Thankfully, email sessions already in progress are not impacted. However, if you were not previously logged in and have 2-Step on your account, that log in attempt will have failed.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">At 10:45 a.m., we temporarily enabled a series of IP addresses on campus so that individuals who are currently on campus will not have to validate with 2-Step Verification. This will mitigate some of the impact and help those on campus today resume normal activities. We recognize that many in our community may be off campus today and that this is a significant inconvenience that limits the ability to get work done.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We continue to be in contact with Microsoft for the latest updates and will send an additional message once the situation has been rectified or once more detailed information is made available.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We appreciate your understanding and patience on this issue.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Regards,</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Chris Kielt</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Vice Chancellor for Information Technology</span></p>
