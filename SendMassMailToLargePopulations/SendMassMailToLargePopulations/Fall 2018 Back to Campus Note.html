                <p>Dear students,</p>
                <p>Welcome back to Chapel Hill. At the beginning of each semester, I like to remind our student community of the technology resources available to them on campus. Whether you are embarking on your first day as a Tar Heel or starting your last semester, ITS is here to help enhance your campus experience.</p>
                <p><b><strong>Keep Your Accounts Secure with 2-Step</strong></b></p>
                <p>2-Step Verification will be required to access email very shortly in the Fall semester. But why wait to protect your account? You can take action now and sign up early for 2-Step. Visit onyen.unc.edu and click on "2-Step for Office 365" to get started. If you have questions, you can visit its.unc.edu/2-step.</p>
                <p><b><strong>Getting Started Guide</strong></b></p>
                <p>We've put together a helpful IT guide just for students, available by visiting its.unc.edu and clicking "Getting Started Guide" in the main menu. There you'll find information about Adobe Creative Cloud, Sakai, WiFi, CCI Printing, WordPress and more.</p>
                <p><b><strong>Need IT help?</strong></b></p>
                <p>Remember, you can always visit help.unc.edu to search for and find answers to common tech questions. If you need additional help, you can chat live with one of our support specialists or submit a help ticket online. You can also call 919.962.HELP for assistance or visit our locations at SASB and the Undergraduate Library.</p>
                
                <p>Again, welcome back to campus, and best wishes for a successful and safe Fall semester.</p>
                <p>Best regards,</p>
                <p>Chris Kielt, Vice Chancellor for Information Technology and Chief Information Officer</p>
