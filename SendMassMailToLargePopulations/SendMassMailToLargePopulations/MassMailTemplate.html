                <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Dear Faculty, Staff and Students:</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Influenza, “flu,” activity typically starts to peak in December, per the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season.htm">Centers for Disease Control</a>. The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by Influenza viruses, which can cause mild to severe illness. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting vaccinated each year.</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Flu vaccinations are still available on campus at the <a href="https://campushealth.unc.edu/services/pharmacy-services">Student Stores Pharmacy and Campus Health Pharmacy</a> for students, faculty and staff. Or, you can find a flu clinic off campus by going to <a href="http://www.flu.nc.gov/">flu.nc.gov</a>.</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">This year, we have partnered with <a href="http://www.alanasfoundation.org/about_us">Alana’s Foundation</a> to track our campus participation in a national university competition. After getting vaccinated, faculty, staff, students, alumni and fans can visit <a href="http://go.unc.edu/flushot">http://go.unc.edu/flushot</a> to fill out a brief survey and put a point on UNC's participation scoreboard. The contest runs through Dec. 7. Currently, we are winning in our bracket, and we have a week left for participation – it’s not too late to help Carolina win. Follow along on social media with #GiveItYourBestShot.</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Help prevent the spread of the flu on campus by recognizing the symptoms and staying at home. The flu spreads by coughing and sneezing and by touching infected surfaces. Someone with the flu can be infectious one day before symptoms and up to seven days after becoming ill. Learn more at Campus Health’s <a href="https://campushealth.unc.edu/news-events/features/flu-vaccines-available">website</a> and at <a href="https://flu.unc.edu/">flu.unc.edu</a>.   </span></p>  <p> </p>  <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Sincerely,</span></p>  <p><br /><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Mary Beth Koza, Executive Director, Environment, Health and Safety</span></p>  <p><br /><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Thevy S.
